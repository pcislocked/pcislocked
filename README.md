### pcislocked github page

This is a page for pcislocked, the maniac that goes crazy on the internet since 2011. No, it's not a three person thing. It's one person only.

My github page will contain information about the pcislocked himself(I'm a male till someone cuts my dick off), how to reach me and stuff like that.

Also I will upload my stupid programming stuff here as well.
